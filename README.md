The objective of this task is to build a machine learning model that can predict future outcomes by learning patterns from historical data. Predictive analysis plays a major role in real-world decision making, such as forecasting sales, identifying risks, predicting customer behavior, or estimating prices. In this project, a dataset is used where each record contains multiple input features along with a target value that needs to be predicted.

The first step of the task involves loading and understanding the dataset. The data is cleaned to remove missing values, incorrect entries, and inconsistencies. This ensures that the model learns from accurate and meaningful information. After cleaning, exploratory data analysis is performed to understand how different features relate to the target variable. Graphs and summary statistics help in identifying trends, outliers, and important relationships within the data.

Once the data is prepared, feature selection is carried out. This step helps in choosing the most relevant input variables that contribute the most to the prediction. Reducing unnecessary features makes the model more efficient and improves accuracy. The dataset is then divided into two parts: a training set and a testing set. The training set is used to teach the model, while the testing set is used to check how well the model performs on new, unseen data.

A regression or classification algorithm is selected based on the nature of the problem. The model is trained using the training data, during which it learns how the input features influence the output. After training, the model is used to make predictions on the test data. These predictions are compared with the actual values to measure performance.
